                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.</p>
                    <p>This tutorial has been prepared for JavaScript beginners to help them understand the basic functionality of JavaScript to build dynamic web pages and web applications.</p>
                    <h3 class="toc-no-section">The plan</h3>
                    <p>For this tutorial, it is assumed that the reader have a prior knowledge of HTML coding. It would help if the reader had some prior exposure to object-oriented programming concepts and a general idea on creating online applications.</p>

                    <h2>Variables</h2>
                    <p>One of the most fundamental characteristics of a programming language is the set of data types it supports. These are the type of values that can be represented and manipulated in a programming language.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript allows you to work with three primitive data types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Numbers, eg. 123, 120.50 etc.</li>
                        <li>Strings of text e.g. "This text string" etc.</li>
                        <li>Boolean e.g. true or false.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>JavaScript also defines two trivial data types, null and undefined, each of which defines only a single value. In addition to these primitive data types, JavaScript supports a composite data type known as object. We will cover objects in detail in a separate chapter.</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
                        int someInteger = 999;
                        bool someBoolean = true;
                        char someCharacter = "M";
                    </code></pre>

                    <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
                    <p>Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions. You can use conditional statements in your code to do this. In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true</li>
                        <li>Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false</li>
                        <li>Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false</li>
                        <li>Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>if...else</h3>
                    <p>While writing a program, there may be a situation when you need to adopt one out of a given set of paths. In such cases, you need to use conditional statements that allow your program to make correct decisions and perform right actions.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript supports conditional statements which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Here we will explain the if..else statement.</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
                        if (x != true) {
                            printf_s("This statement is false.");
                        } else {
                            printf_s("This statement is true.");
                        }
                    </code></pre>

                    <h3>Switch</h3>
                    <p>You can use multiple if...else statements, as in the previous chapter, to perform a multiway branch. However, this is not always the best solution, especially when all of the branches depend on the value of a single variable.</p>
                    <p>Starting with JavaScript 1.2, you can use a switch statement which handles exactly this situation, and it does so more efficiently than repeated if...else if statements.</p>

                    <h2>Loops</h2>
                    <p>You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction then Y steps in another; for example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:</p>
                    <p>There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times (and it's actually possible that number could be zero). The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.</p>

                    <h3>For Loop</h3>
                    <p>A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop. A for statement looks as follows:</p>


                    <div class="code-output">
                            <div class="pre code-cpp">
                                <span class="pre-heading">C++</span>
                                <pre><code class="language-cpp">
                                    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++ ) {
                                        printf_s("i = %d", i);
                                    }
                                </code></pre>

                                <pre><code class="language-xxxx">
                                    i = 0
                                    i = 1
                                    i = 2
                                    i = 3
                                    i = 4
                                </code></pre>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    <p>When a for loop executes, the following occurs:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The initializing expression initialExpression, if any, is executed. This expression usually initializes one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any degree of complexity. This expression can also declare variables.</li>
                        <li>The condition expression is evaluated. If the value of condition is true, the loop statements execute. If the value of condition is false, the for loop terminates. If the condition expression is omitted entirely, the condition is assumed to be true.</li>
                        <li>The statement executes. To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.</li>
                        <li>If present, the update expression incrementExpression is executed.</li>
                        <li>Control returns to step 2.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>While Loop</h3>
                    <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
                        while (x == false) {
                            // Do this until x is true
                        }
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop. The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while. To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.</p>

                    <h2>Functions</h2>
                    <p>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
                        int myFunction(n1, n2) {
                            return n1 + n2;
                        }
                    </code></pre>

                    <h3>Function Syntax</h3>
                    <p>A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses (). Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables). The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas: (parameter1, parameter2, ...)</p>
                    <p>The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}<p>
                    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
                        int name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
                            //code to be executed
                        }
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>Function parameters are the names listed in the function definition. Function arguments are the real values received by the function when it is invoked. Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.</p>
